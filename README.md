# Minishell
This is one of the main project of 42, the goal was to reproduce the behavior of the shell "bash". We used with Dgauvin linked list, signals, Process-based parallelism etc. We also achieve to do bonuses so && and || are implemented, wildcards too. Feel free to reach me for more details.
